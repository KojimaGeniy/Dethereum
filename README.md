# Dethereum

Includes already deployed to Rinkeby network contract, that corresponds for Initializing game session, entering session and withdraw winnings for Decentralized Battle Royal game Dethereum (currently under heavy development).
Soon about to be added Unity C# Script to interact with deployed contract and create ETH accounts on the fly.

Requires Nethereum Unity library for connecting to Ethereum Network through Unity.
